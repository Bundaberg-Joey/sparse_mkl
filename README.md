# Sparse_mkl
* repo containing all PhD code needed for the sparse models /associated kernels and hdf5 dataclasses

## TODO:
* determine the inducing matrices for each feature (physical, PCFP_0, PCFP_1, PCFP_2) -> can use KMeans for physical but use a different clustering for the PCFP approaches
* RBF size = 100%
* each PCFP matrix to be 33% since there will be three of them in total
* Message gael saying should be good to go whenever he is (tbh just speak to him on Thursday)
